Hello!  I'm a web developer and a musician from San Francisco, California.

I'm currently the lead software developer for <a href="https://appsumo.com/collections/appsumo-originals/" target="_blank">AppSumo Originals</a>, working on projects like <a href="https://tidycal.com" target="_blank">TidyCal</a>, <a href="https://sendfox.com">SendFox</a>, and others.  Here you'll find some information about my personal projects, interests, and other goings-on.

Also offer a plan for anyone who needs professional help maintaining and updating their website.  You can learn more on the [services](/services) page.

I'd love to hear from you, feel free to email me below.  I'm always happy to chat about programming, music, and anything in between.
