<p>Here's a function I wrote while working on a project that pops up a box confirming whether or not the user is sure the want to go to a link they clicked, like <a class="confirm" href="http://www.grimmdude.com/confirming-a-link-click-with-jquery/" title="This link will popup a confirmation box and bring you back to this post if you click OK.">this</a>.</p>
<p>It may be simple, but I haven't really used javascript's confirm() function much in the past and everything I found only directed the user to a link predefined in the function.  I wanted a function that would confirm any link I wanted it to without knowing the link destination in advance, in other words I wanted to confirm dynamic links.</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>This jQuery function will pop up a confirmation box on any link with the class <code>confirm</code> and send the user to the destination of that link if they click 'OK'.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
$(function() {
  $('a.confirm').click(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    var url = $(this).attr('href');
    var confirm_box = confirm('Are you sure you want to click this link?');
    if (confirm_box) {
       window.location = url;
       //uncomment below and remove above if you want the link to open in a new window
       //window.open(url,'_blank');
    }
  });
});
