Have you ever opened a website and said to yourself "I'd like to look at this more, but maybe later"?  This extension makes it simple to remind yourself to revisit any website when you decide.

Reminders are shown as native Chrome notifications, and when clicked you will be taken back to the site.  You can also snooze reminders for 15 minutes.
